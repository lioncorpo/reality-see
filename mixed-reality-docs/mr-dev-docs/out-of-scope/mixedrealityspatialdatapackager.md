# Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager Documentation

>[!NOTE]
> DEPRECATED 
> 
> As of 8/1/2020 this tool is now deprecated and no longer functions on any platform. We recommend using the [Map Manager](../develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal.md#map-manager) tool in the Device Portal instead. 
> 
> This tool and its operation are offered as-is. It is subject to change without any notice and may not be compatible with future Windows or Windows Mixed Reality HMD releases.

## Quickstart

The Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager tool copies the spatial data of a target app from one PC to another through a two step export and import process. The tool must be run with administrator privileges and deletes the existing spatial data on import. Export leaves the existing spatial data intact.

Key requirements and limitations:

1. Tool must be run with administrator privileges 
2. You may have to restart PC if Mixed Reality Portal is unstable after running the tool
3. Tool will not run when encountering spatial data version mismatches or incompatibilities
4. Tool will erase existing spatial data on import
5. If import process fails previous data cannot be restored unless it has been backed up by exporting previously
6. Quality of import functionality contingent on “Read-Only” mode for spatial map data
***

## Mapping Best Practices

1. Clear existing maps from the Control Panel (Settings -> Mixed Reality -> Environment -> Clear environment data)
2. Ensure sufficient lighting for good tracking and if running locked map mode try to maintain the same lighting
3. When possible keep the lighting dynamic range low by avoiding areas of high illumination next to dark, shadowed areas
4. Minimize blank, textureless surfaces e.g. place a range of different posters on white walls
5. Map the space without dynamic objects in the scene such as moving people
6. Lock the map on import (available via Insider Preview)
7. Unlock the map and rescan the environment when tracking quality degrades and/or there are changes in the environment (lighting or changes in object layout)

## Running Mixed Reality Spatial Data Packager with Companion Script

We have provided MRSpatialPackagerHelperScript.ps1 that runs the map packager the tools. 


The script parameters are defined below:

```
-AppName <String>
    On export: The spatial anchors from the app of interest
    On import: The target app that spatial anchors should be imported for
    Returns a list of apps containing the input string if a unique app is not found

-UserName <String>
    Target username, will return a list of users if a unique match is not found

-Mode <String>
    import or export

-MapxPath <String>
    On export: Directory to export your mapx files
    On import: Directory where import mapx are stored

-LockMap <Int32>
    0 to unlock map
    1 to lock map

-BinPath <String>
    Path to MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe, default value is current directory
```

### Powershell Script Example Usage and Output

.\MRSpatialPackagerHelperScript.ps1 -AppName holoshell -UserName Administrator -Mode export -MapxPath D:\temp\ -LockMap 0
```
Package Family Name for holoshell: HoloShell_cw5n1h2txyewy
User SID for Administrator: S-1-5-21-1279937937-3984375698-1043392598-499
Lock map value successfully set to 0

Running: C:\bin\MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe export D:\temp\ HoloShell_cw5n1h2txyewy S-1-5-21-1279937937-3984375698-1043392598-499

### How to Export using MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe
```
MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe export <folderpath to mapx files> <source package family name>    
```

Exporting maps off device generates two mapx files, het.mapx and sa.mapx. During the export process all spatial anchors are removed except for the specified app and the user-created boundary (if it exists). The source package family name must match an existing installed app or the exe will fail.

### How to Import using MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe
```
MixedRealitySpatialDataPackager.exe import <folderpath to mapx files> <target package family name> <user SID>
```
Import deletes the existing spatial data and replaces it with the data from the specified directory. The app name input specifies the package name of the target app that like the spatial anchors should be imported for and the target user SID specifies the user that should have access to the imported spatial anchors. The target package family name and user SIDs must match existing values on the PC or the exe will fail.
