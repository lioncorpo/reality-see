# Installing PIX for HoloLens 2

[PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix) is a performance tuning and debugging tool for DirectX 12 applications on Windows. 

## Setup

1. Grab the latest PIX [release]( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download) from your host PC and connect your HoloLens 2 to your PC via a USB cable.

2. If your HoloLens 2 is on a [Windows Insider build](https://insider.windows.com) or has a configuration that breaks PIX,  [reflash your device](/hololens/hololens-recovery) to erase all data.

3. Enable **Developer Mode** and **Device Portal**:

* Open **Settings** from Mixed Reality Home:

* Select **Update & Security**:

* Select **For Developers**:

* With the device still connected, awake, and with the user logged in, launch Visual Studio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your device isn't in standby mode or asleep. If you're having trouble with this step, refer to the [Windows Device Portal instructions](./using-the-windows-device-portal.md).

## Preparing for deployment

1. In Visual Studio, set **ARM64** as the platform and **Device** as the device:

2. When Visual Studio prompts you for a **PIN** from the device:

* Select **Settings** from Shell
* Select **Update & Security**
* Select **For Developers** and press Pair under **Device Discovery**

* Enter the generated PIN number in Visual Studio

3. Visual Studio will deploy the app to the connected HoloLens 2, which may take a few minutes depending on the app.

## Launching PIX

First, use Device Portal to verify the app isn't running on the HoloLens 2. Then, launch PIX, connect to your device, and select **Home**:

2. From the **Computer** tab, select **Add**, and enter the following credentials:
    * Alias: Up to userâ€™s discretion
    * Host Name or IP Address: 127.0.0.1

3. Select **Connect** in the lower right of the **Computer** tab:

> [!NOTE]
> The first connection is always slower because binaries are being copied.

4. When PIX has connected to the HoloLens 2, find your app in the **Select Target Process** section in the Launch UWP tab, and select **Launch**:

> If you collect timing data after taking a GPU capture, you'll be required to reboot the headset. This is a one-time restart of the device and is required for timing data collection.

PIX is now ready for use!
