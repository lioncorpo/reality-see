# Perception simulation

Do you want to build an automated test for your app? Do you want your tests to go beyond component-level unit testing and really exercise your app end-to-end? Perception Simulation is what you're looking for. The Perception Simulation library sends human and world input data to your app so you can automate your tests. For example, you can simulate the input of a human looking to a specific, repeatable position and then use a gesture or motion controller.

Perception Simulation can send simulated input like this to a physical HoloLens, the HoloLens emulator (first gen), the HoloLens 2 Emulator, or a PC with Mixed Reality Portal installed. Perception Simulation bypasses the live sensors on a Mixed Reality device and sends simulated input to applications running on the device. Applications receive these input events through the same APIs they always use and can't tell the difference between running with real sensors versus Perception Simulation. Perception Simulation is the same technology used by the HoloLens emulators to send simulated input to the HoloLens Virtual Machine.

To begin using simulation in your code, start by creating an IPerceptionSimulationManager object. From that object, you can issue commands to control properties of a simulated "human", including head position, hand position, and gestures. You can also enable and manipulate motion controllers.

## Setting Up a Visual Studio Project for Perception Simulation
1. [Install the HoloLens emulator](../install-the-tools.md) on your development PC. The emulator includes the libraries you' use for Perception Simulation.
2. Create a new Visual Studio C# desktop project (a Console Project works great to get started).
3. Add the following binaries to your project as references (Project->Add->Reference...). You can find them in %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft XDE\\(version), such as **%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft XDE\\10.0.18362.0** for the HoloLens 2 Emulator.  (Note: although the binaries are part of the HoloLens 2 Emulator, they also work for Windows Mixed Reality on the desktop.)
    a. PerceptionSimulationManager.Interop.dll - Managed C# wrapper for Perception Simulation.
    b. PerceptionSimulationRest.dll - Library for setting up a web-socket communication channel to the HoloLens or emulator.
    c. SimulationStream.Interop.dll - Shared types for simulation.
4. Add the implementation binary PerceptionSimulationManager.dll to your project
    a. First add it as a binary to the project (Project->Add->Existing Item...). Save it as a link so that it doesn't copy it to your project source folder. ![Add PerceptionSimulationManager.dll to the project as a link](images/saveaslink.png)
    b. Then make sure that it gets copied to your output folder on build. This is in the property sheet for the binary. ![Mark PerceptionSimulationManager.dll to copy to the output directory](images/copyalways.png)
5. Set your active solution platform to x64.  (Use the Configuration Manager to create a Platform entry for x64 if one doesn't already exist.)

## Creating an IPerceptionSimulation Manager Object

To control simulation, you'll issue updates to objects retrieved from an IPerceptionSimulationManager object. The first step is to get that object and connect it to your target device or emulator. You can get the IP address of your emulator by clicking on the Device Portal button in the [toolbar](using-the-hololens-emulator.md)

![Open Device Portal icon](images/emulator-deviceportal.png) **Open Device Portal**: Open the Windows Device Portal for the HoloLens OS in the emulator.  For Windows Mixed Reality, this can be retrieved in the Settings app under "Update & Security", then "For developers" in the "Connect using:" section under "Enable Device Portal."  Be sure to note both the IP address and port.

First, you'll call RestSimulationStreamSink.Create to get a RestSimulationStreamSink object. This is the target device or emulator that you'll control over an http connection. Your commands will be passed to and handled by the [Windows Device Portal](using-the-windows-device-portal.md) running on the device or emulator. The four parameters you'll need to create an object are:
* Uri uri - IP address of the target device (e.g., "https://123.123.123.123" or "https://123.123.123.123:50080")
* System.Net.NetworkCredential credentials - Username/password for connecting to the [Windows Device Portal](using-the-windows-device-portal.md) on the target device or emulator. If you're connecting to the emulator via its local address (e.g., 168.*.*.*) on the same PC, any credentials will be accepted.
* bool normal - True for normal priority, false for low priority. You generally want to set this to *true* for test scenarios, which allows your test to take control.  The emulator and Windows Mixed Reality simulation use low-priority connections.  If your test also uses a low-priority connection, the most recently established connection will be in control.
* System.Threading.CancellationToken token - Token to cancel the async operation.

Second, you'll create the IPerceptionSimulationManager. This is the object you use to control simulation. This must also be done in an async method.

## Control the simulated Human

An IPerceptionSimulationManager has a Human property that returns an ISimulatedHuman object. To control the simulated human, perform operations on this object. For example:

```
manager.Human.Move(new Vector3(0.1f, 0.0f, 0.0f))
```

## Note on 6-DOF controllers

Before calling any properties on methods on a simulated 6-DOF controller, you must activate the controller.  Not doing so will result in an exception.  Starting with the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, simulated 6-DOF controllers can be installed and activated by setting the Status property on the ISimulatedSixDofController object to SimulatedSixDofControllerStatus.Active.
In the Windows 10 October 2018 Update and earlier, you must separately install a simulated 6-DOF controller first by calling the PerceptionSimulationDevice tool located in the \Windows\System32 folder.  The usage of this tool is as follows:


```
    PerceptionSimulationDevice.exe <action> 6dof <instance>
```

For example

```
    PerceptionSimulationDevice.exe i 6dof 1
```

Supported actions are:
* i = install
* q = query
* r = remove

Supported instances are:
* 1 = the left 6-DOF controller
* 2 = the right 6-DOF controller

The exit code of the process will indicate success (a zero return value) or failure (a non-zero return value).  When using the 'q' action to query whether a controller is installed, the return value will be zero (0) if the controller isn't already installed or one (1) if the controller is installed.

When removing a controller on the Windows 10 October 2018 Update or earlier, set its status to Off via the API first, then call the PerceptionSimulationDevice tool.

This tool must be run as Administrator.
