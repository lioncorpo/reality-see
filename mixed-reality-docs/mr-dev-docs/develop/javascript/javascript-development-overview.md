# JavaScript development overview

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world! It's simple, lightweight, and widely used on the web. Leverage the power of your JavaScript and web skills to create more engaging Mixed Reality experiences.

## Mixed Reality applications on the web

Mixed Reality features are available on the web by the use of [WebXR](webxr-overview.md). You can see virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) content in a compatible WebXR-enabled browser without installing any additional software or plugins. You can use that same browser with a physical device like the HoloLens 2. Check out our [WebXR](webxr-overview.md) documentation for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> **WebVR** is deprecated and is not available in current browsers, hence it should not be used for any new development. You will need to migrate any existing **WebVR** implementations forward to **WebXR**.

## What can I use to develop immersive web experiences?

The following list shows the JavaScript frameworks and APIs for building immersive experiences that currently dominate the market and are widely accepted and adopted by Mixed Reality JavaScript developers:

|[**Babylon.js**](https://doc.babylonjs.com/)<br/><br/> Babylon is a JavaScript 3D engine that makes developing 3D content and immersive applications easy. Before getting started with immersive applications, we recommend to learn the basics of Babylon.js development.<br/><br/>- Learn how to build 3D applications with babylon.js [Getting started](https://doc.babylonjs.com/start).<br/>- Play with 3D examples and their source code using babylon.js [Playground](https://doc.babylonjs.com/examples/)<br/>- Dive deeper into [WebXR](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/webXR)<br/>- Learn how to get started with our tutorials [Create your first "Hello World!" app](tutorials/babylonjs-webxr-helloworld/introduction-01.md)|![BabylonJS Logo](images/babylon.js.example.png) |
|[**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/) <br/><br/>A-frame is a declarative JavaScript framework to get started with Virtual Reality in the web. Check out the [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/) to learn more. |![A-Frame](images/a-frame.example.png)  |
|[**Three.js**](https://threejs.org) <br/><br/>Three.js is a popular 3D library for creating immersive experiences. Learn more about [three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) in documentation page and by exploring [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth). |![Three.js](images/three.js.example.png)  |
|[**WebGL**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)  <br/><br/>You can access the WebXR Device APIs directly by using WebGL APIs. WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. |![WebGL](images/webgl.example.png)  |
