# MR Spatial 230: Spatial mapping

>[!NOTE]
>The Mixed Reality Academy tutorials were designed with HoloLens (1st gen) and Mixed Reality Immersive Headsets in mind.  As such, we feel it is important to leave these tutorials in place for developers who are still looking for guidance in developing for those devices.  These tutorials will **_not_** be updated with the latest toolsets or interactions being used for HoloLens 2.  They will be maintained to continue working on the supported devices. [A new series of tutorials](../../../mr-learning-base-01.md) has been posted for HoloLens 2.

[Spatial mapping](../../../design/spatial-mapping.md) combines the real world and virtual world together by teaching holograms about the environment. In MR Spatial 230 (Project Planetarium) we'll learn how to:

* Scan the environment and transfer data from the HoloLens to your development machine.
* Explore shaders and learn how to use them for visualizing your space.
* Break down the room mesh into simple planes using mesh processing.
* Go beyond the placement techniques we learned in [MR Basics 101](../../../develop/unity/tutorials/holograms-101.md), and provide feedback about where a hologram can be placed in the environment.
* Explore occlusion effects, so when your hologram is behind a real-world object, you can still see it with x-ray vision!

## Chapter 1 - Scanning

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/888oW51z_cE]

**Objectives**

* Learn about the SurfaceObserver and how its settings impact experience and performance.
* Create a room scanning experience to collect the meshes of your room.

**Instructions**

* In the **Project** panel **HoloToolkit-SpatialMapping-230\SpatialMapping\Prefabs** folder, find the **SpatialMapping** prefab.
* Drag & drop the **SpatialMapping** prefab into the **Hierarchy** panel.

**Build and Deploy (part 1)**

* In Unity, select **File > Build Settings**.
* Click **Add Open Scenes** to add the **Planetarium** scene to the build.
* Select **Universal Windows Platform** in the **Platform** list and click **Switch Platform**.
* Set **SDK** to **Universal 10** and **UWP Build Type** to **D3D**.
* Check **Unity C# Projects**.
* Click **Build**.
* Create a **New Folder** named "App".
* Single click the **App** folder.
* Press the **Select Folder** button.
* When Unity is done building, a File Explorer window will appear.
* Double-click on the **App** folder to open it.
* Double-click on **Planetarium.sln** to load the project in Visual Studio.
* In Visual Studio, use the top toolbar to change the Configuration to **Release**.
* Change the Platform to **x86**.
* Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of 'Local Machine', and select **Remote Machine**.
* Enter [your device's IP address](../../../connecting-to-wi-fi-on-hololens.md#identifying-the-ip-address-of-your-hololens-on-the-wi-fi-network) in the Address field and change Authentication Mode to **Universal (Unencrypted Protocol)**.
* Click **Debug -> Start Without debugging** or press **Ctrl + F5**.
* Watch the **Output** panel in Visual Studio for build and deploy status.
* Once your app has deployed, walk around the room. You will see the surrounding surfaces covered by black and white wireframe meshes.
* Scan your surroundings. Be sure to look at walls, ceilings, and floors.

**Build and Deploy (part 2)**

Now let's explore how Spatial Mapping can affect performance.

* In Unity, select **Window > Profiler**.
* Click **Add Profiler > GPU**.
* Click **Active Profiler > <Enter IP>**.
* Enter the **IP address** of your HoloLens.
* Click **Connect**.
* Observe the number of milliseconds it takes for the GPU to render a frame.
* Stop the application from running on the device.
* Return to Visual Studio and open **SpatialMappingObserver.cs**. You will find it in the HoloToolkit\SpatialMapping folder of the Assembly-CSharp (Universal Windows) project.
* Find the **Awake()** function, and add the following line of code: **TrianglesPerCubicMeter = 1200;**
* Re-deploy the project to your device, and then **reconnect the profiler**. Observe the change in the number of milliseconds to render a frame.
* Stop the application from running on the device.

**Save and load in Unity**

Finally, let's save our room mesh and load it into Unity.

* Return to Visual Studio and remove the **TrianglesPerCubicMeter** line that you added in the **Awake()** function during the previous section.
* Redeploy the project to your device. We should now be running with **500** triangles per cubic meter.
* Open a browser and enter in your HoloLens IPAddress to navigate to the **Windows Device Portal**.
* Select the **3D View** option in the left panel.
* Under **Surface reconstruction** select the **Update** button.
* Watch as the areas that you have scanned on your HoloLens appear in the display window.
* To save your room scan, press the **Save** button.
* Open your **Downloads** folder to find the saved room model **SRMesh.obj**.
* Copy **SRMesh.obj** to the **Assets** folder of your Unity project.
* In Unity, select the **SpatialMapping** object in the **Hierarchy** panel.
* Locate the **Object Surface Observer (Script)** component.
* Click the circle to the right of the **Room Model** property.
* Find and select the **SRMesh** object and then close the window.
* Verify that the **Room Model** property in the **Inspector** panel is now set to **SRMesh**.
* Press the **Play** button to enter Unity's preview mode.
* The SpatialMapping component will load the meshes from the saved room model so you can use them in Unity.
* Switch to **Scene** view to see all of your room model displayed with the wireframe shader.
* Press the **Play** button again to exit preview mode.

**NOTE:** The next time that you enter preview mode in Unity, it will load the saved room mesh by default.

## Chapter 2 - Visualization

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnkvXl-aXD4]

**Objectives**

* Learn the basics of shaders.
* Visualize your surroundings.

**Instructions**

* In Unity's **Hierarchy** panel, select the **SpatialMapping** object.
* In the **Inspector** panel, find the **Spatial Mapping Manager (Script)** component.
* Click the circle to the right of the **Surface Material** property.
* Find and select the **BlueLinesOnWalls** material and close the window.
* In the **Project** panel **Shaders** folder, double-click on **BlueLinesOnWalls** to open the shader in Visual Studio.
* This is a simple pixel (vertex to fragment) shader, which accomplishes the following tasks:
    1. Converts a vertex's location to world space.
    2. Checks the vertex's normal to determine if a pixel is vertical.
    3. Sets the color of the pixel for rendering.

**Build and Deploy**

* Return to Unity and press **Play** to enter preview mode.
* Blue lines will be rendered on all vertical surfaces of the room mesh (which automatically loaded from our saved scanning data).
* Switch to the **Scene** tab to adjust your view of the room and see how the entire room mesh appears in Unity.
* In the **Project** panel, find the **Materials** folder and select the **BlueLinesOnWalls** material.
* Modify some properties and see how the changes appear in the Unity editor.
    * In the **Inspector** panel, adjust the **LineScale** value to make the lines appear thicker or thinner.
    * In the **Inspector** panel, adjust the **LinesPerMeter** value to change how many lines appear on each wall.
* Click **Play** again to exit preview mode.
* Build and deploy to the HoloLens and observe how the shader rendering appears on real surfaces.

Unity does a great job of previewing materials, but it's always a good idea to check-out rendering in the device.

## Chapter 3 - Processing

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaUKiNiDxwY]

**Objectives**

* Learn techniques to process spatial mapping data for use in your application.
* Analyze spatial mapping data to find planes and remove triangles.
* Use planes for hologram placement.

**Instructions**

* In Unity's **Project** panel, **Holograms** folder, find the **SpatialProcessing** object.
* Drag & drop the **SpatialProcessing** object into the **Hierarchy** panel.

The SpatialProcessing prefab includes components for processing the spatial mapping data. **SurfaceMeshesToPlanes.cs** will find and generate planes based on the spatial mapping data. We will use planes in our application to represent walls, floors and ceilings. This prefab also includes **RemoveSurfaceVertices.cs** which can remove vertices from the spatial mapping mesh. This can be used to create holes in the mesh, or to remove excess triangles that are no longer needed (because planes can be used instead).

* In Unity's **Project** panel, **Holograms** folder, find the **SpaceCollection** object.
* Drag and drop the **SpaceCollection** object into the **Hierarchy** panel.
* In the **Hierarchy** panel, select the **SpatialProcessing** object.
* In the **Inspector** panel, find the **Play Space Manager (Script)** component.
* Double-click on **PlaySpaceManager.cs** to open it in Visual Studio.

PlaySpaceManager.cs contains application-specific code. We will add functionality to this script to enable the following behavior:

1. Stop collecting spatial mapping data after we exceed the scanning time limit (10 seconds).
2. Process the spatial mapping data:
    1. Use SurfaceMeshesToPlanes to create a simpler representation of the world as planes (walls, floors, ceilings, etc).
    2. Use RemoveSurfaceVertices to remove surface triangles that fall within plane boundaries.
3. Generate a collection of holograms in the world and place them on wall and floor planes near the user.

Complete the coding exercises marked in PlaySpaceManager.cs, or replace the script with the finished solution from below:

**Build and Deploy**

* Before deploying to the HoloLens, press the **Play** button in Unity to enter play mode.
* After the room mesh is loaded from file, wait for 10 seconds before processing starts on the spatial mapping mesh.
* When processing is complete, planes will appear to represent the floor, walls, ceiling, etc.
* After all of the planes have been found, you should see a solar system appear on a table of floor near the camera.
* Two posters should appear on walls near the camera too. Switch to the **Scene** tab if you cannot see them in **Game** mode.
* Press the **Play** button again to exit play mode.
* Build and deploy to the HoloLens, as usual.
* Wait for scanning and processing of the spatial mapping data to complete.
* Once you see planes, try to find the solar system and posters in your world.

## Chapter 4 - Placement

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/Srhtpid1uZc]

**Objectives**

* Determine if a hologram will fit on a surface.
* Provide feedback to the user when a hologram can/cannot fit on a surface.

**Instructions**

* In Unity's **Hierarchy** panel, select the **SpatialProcessing** object.
* In the **Inspector** panel, find the **Surface Meshes To Planes (Script)** component.
* Change the **Draw Planes** property to **Nothing** to clear the selection.
* Change the **Draw Planes** property to **Wall**, so that only wall planes will be rendered.
* In the **Project** panel, **Scripts** folder, double-click on **Placeable.cs** to open it in Visual Studio.

The **Placeable** script is already attached to the posters and projection box that are created after plane finding completes. All we need to do is uncomment some code, and this script will achieve the following:

1. Determine if a hologram will fit on a surface by raycasting from the center and four corners of the bounding cube.
2. Check the surface normal to determine if it is smooth enough for the hologram to sit flush on.
3. Render a bounding cube around the hologram to show its actual size while being placed.
4. Cast a shadow under/behind the hologram to show where it will be placed on the floor/wall.
5. Render the shadow as red, if the hologram cannot be placed on the surface, or green, if it can.
6. Re-orient the hologram to align with the surface type (vertical or horizontal) that it has affinity to.
7. Smoothly place the hologram on the selected surface to avoid jumping or snapping behavior.

Uncomment all code in the coding exercise below, or use this completed solution in **Placeable.cs**:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Academy.HoloToolkit.Unity;

/// <summary>
/// Enumeration containing the surfaces on which a GameObject
/// can be placed.  For simplicity of this sample, only one
/// surface type is allowed to be selected.
/// </summary>
public enum PlacementSurfaces
{
    // Horizontal surface with an upward pointing normal.
    Horizontal = 1,

    // Vertical surface with a normal facing the user.
    Vertical = 2,
}

/// <summary>
/// The Placeable class implements the logic used to determine if a GameObject
/// can be placed on a target surface. Constraints for placement include:
/// * No part of the GameObject's box collider impacts with another object in the scene
/// * The object lays flat (within specified tolerances) against the surface
/// * The object would not fall off of the surface if gravity were enabled.
/// This class also provides the following visualizations.
/// * A transparent cube representing the object's box collider.
/// * Shadow on the target surface indicating whether or not placement is valid.
/// </summary>

**Build and Deploy**

* As before, build the project and deploy to the HoloLens.
* Wait for scanning and processing of the spatial mapping data to complete.
* When you see the solar system, gaze at the projection box below and perform a select gesture to move it around. While the projection box is selected, a bounding cube will be visible around the projection box.
* Move you head to gaze at a different location in the room. The projection box should follow your gaze. When the shadow below the projection box turns red, you cannot place the hologram on that surface. When the shadow below the projection box turns green, you can place the hologram by performing another select gesture.
* Find and select one of the holographic posters on a wall to move it to a new location. Notice that you cannot place the poster on the floor or ceiling, and that it stays correctly oriented to each wall as you move around.

## Chapter 5 - Occlusion

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Xrzh_w-7SE]

**Objectives**

* Determine if a hologram is occluded by the spatial mapping mesh.
* Apply different occlusion techniques to achieve a fun effect.

**Instructions**

First, we are going to allow the spatial mapping mesh to occlude other holograms without occluding the real world:

* In the **Hierarchy** panel, select the **SpatialProcessing** object.
* In the **Inspector** panel, find the **Play Space Manager (Script)** component.
* Click the circle to the right of the **Secondary Material** property.
* Find and select the **Occlusion** material and close the window.

Next, we are going to add a special behavior to Earth, so that it has a blue highlight whenever it becomes occluded by another hologram (like the sun), or by the spatial mapping mesh:

* In the **Project** panel, in the **Holograms** folder, expand the **SolarSystem** object.
* Click on **Earth**.
* In the **Inspector** panel, find the Earth's material (bottom component).
* In the **Shader drop-down**, change the shader to **Custom > OcclusionRim**. This will render a blue highlight around Earth whenever it is occluded by another object.

Finally, we are going to enable an x-ray vision effect for planets in our solar system. We will need to edit **PlanetOcclusion.cs** (found in the Scripts\SolarSystem folder) in order to achieve the following:

1. Determine if a planet is occluded by the SpatialMapping layer (room meshes and planes).
2. Show the wireframe representation of a planet whenever it is occluded by the SpatialMapping layer.
3. Hide the wireframe representation of a planet when it is not blocked by the SpatialMapping layer.

Follow the coding exercise in PlanetOcclusion.cs, or use the following solution:

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using Academy.HoloToolkit.Unity;

/// <summary>
/// Determines when the occluded version of the planet should be visible.
/// This script allows us to do selective occlusion, so the occlusionObject
/// will only be rendered when a Spatial Mapping surface is occluding the planet,
/// not when another hologram is responsible for the occlusion.
/// </summary>
public class PlanetOcclusion : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Tooltip("Object to display when the planet is occluded.")]
    public GameObject occlusionObject;

    /// <summary>
    /// Points to raycast to when checking for occlusion.
    /// </summary>
    private Vector3[] checkPoints;

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start()
    {
        occlusionObject.SetActive(false);

        // Set the check points to use when testing for occlusion.
        MeshFilter filter = gameObject.GetComponent<MeshFilter>();
        Vector3 extents = filter.mesh.bounds.extents;
        Vector3 center = filter.mesh.bounds.center;
        Vector3 top = new Vector3(center.x, center.y + extents.y, center.z);
        Vector3 left = new Vector3(center.x - extents.x, center.y, center.z);
        Vector3 right = new Vector3(center.x + extents.x, center.y, center.z);
        Vector3 bottom = new Vector3(center.x, center.y - extents.y, center.z);

        checkPoints = new Vector3[] { center, top, left, right, bottom };
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        /* TODO: 5.a DEVELOPER CODING EXERCISE 5.a */

        // Check to see if any of the planet's boundary points are occluded.
        for (int i = 0; i < checkPoints.Length; i++)
        {
            // 5.a: Convert the current checkPoint to world coordinates.
            // Call gameObject.transform.TransformPoint(checkPoints[i]).
            // Assign the result to a new Vector3 variable called 'checkPt'.
            Vector3 checkPt = gameObject.transform.TransformPoint(checkPoints[i]);

            // 5.a: Call Vector3.Distance() to calculate the distance
            // between the Main Camera's position and 'checkPt'.
            // Assign the result to a new float variable called 'distance'.
            float distance = Vector3.Distance(Camera.main.transform.position, checkPt);

            // 5.a: Take 'checkPt' and subtract the Main Camera's position from it.
            // Assign the result to a new Vector3 variable called 'direction'.
            Vector3 direction = checkPt - Camera.main.transform.position;

            // Used to indicate if the call to Physics.Raycast() was successful.
            bool raycastHit = false;

            // 5.a: Check if the planet is occluded by a spatial mapping surface.
            // Call Physics.Raycast() with the following arguments:
            // - Pass in the Main Camera's position as the origin.
            // - Pass in 'direction' for the direction.
            // - Pass in 'distance' for the maxDistance.
            // - Pass in SpatialMappingManager.Instance.LayerMask as layerMask.
            // Assign the result to 'raycastHit'.
            raycastHit = Physics.Raycast(Camera.main.transform.position, direction, distance, SpatialMappingManager.Instance.LayerMask);

            if (raycastHit)
            {
                // 5.a: Our raycast hit a surface, so the planet is occluded.
                // Set the occlusionObject to active.
                occlusionObject.SetActive(true);

                // At least one point is occluded, so break from the loop.
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                // 5.a: The Raycast did not hit, so the planet is not occluded.
                // Deactivate the occlusionObject.
                occlusionObject.SetActive(false);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Build and Deploy**

* Build and deploy the application to HoloLens, as usual.
* Wait for scanning and processing of the spatial mapping data to be complete (you should see blue lines appear on walls).
* Find and select the solar system's projection box and then set the box next to a wall or behind a counter.
* You can view basic occlusion by hiding behind surfaces to peer at the poster or projection box.
* Look for the Earth, there should be a blue highlight effect whenever it goes behind another hologram or surface.
* Watch as the planets move behind the wall or other surfaces in the room. You now have x-ray vision and can see their wireframe skeletons!

## The End

Congratulations! You have now completed **MR Spatial 230: Spatial mapping**.

* You know how to scan your environment and load spatial mapping data to Unity.
* You understand the basics of shaders and how materials can be used to re-visualize the world.
* You learned of new processing techniques for finding planes and removing triangles from a mesh.
* You were able to move and place holograms on surfaces that made sense.
* You experienced different occlusion techniques and harnessed the power of x-ray vision!
