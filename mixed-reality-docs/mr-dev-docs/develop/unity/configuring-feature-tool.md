# Configuring the Mixed Reality Feature Tool

When using the Mixed Reality Feature Tool, you have access to three different settings categories that you can customize at will:

* [Download settings](#download-settings)
* [Feature settings](#feature-settings)
* [Import settings](#import-settings)

## Download settings

![Download settings](images/FeatureToolSettings-Download.png)

### Overwrite existing package files

Enabling this setting causes package files to be downloaded every time they're acquired. 

* **We recommend leaving this option disabled to reduce network bandwidth usage**
* By default, previously acquired package files aren't re-downloaded

### Package cache

Change this setting to update the location where feature packages are downloaded.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is **read-only** in this release. Future releases may make this setting configurable.

## Feature settings

### Show preview releases

Enable this setting to acquire preview releases.
* By default, preview releases are not shown in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool 

> [!NOTE]
> A preview release is defined as containing the **"-preview"** designation in the package version.

### Show early access program features

Enable this setting to acquire features from registered early access programs releases.

* By default, early access features are not shown in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool 

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling `Show early access program features` without `Show preview releases` may result in eary access packages not appearing in Discovery.

## Import settings

### Replace existing package files

By default, the Mixed Reality Feature Tool removes previous copies of the packages being imported to reduce the file size and unnecessary computations. 

* Uncheck this setting to keep all versions

### Project relative import path

Change this setting to update project folder path where feature packages are copied on import. 

* For example, if the project folder is **C:\GalaxyExplorer**, the fully qualified import path will be **C:\GalaxyExplorer\Packages\MixedReality**.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is **read-only** in this release. Future releases may make this setting configurable.

## Early Access settings
