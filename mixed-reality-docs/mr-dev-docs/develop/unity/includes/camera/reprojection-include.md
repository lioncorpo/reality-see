MRTK doesn't currently have helpers for the reprojection mode. Please see one of the other tabs for more information.

# [XR SDK](#tab/xr)
<!-- NEVER CHANGE THE ABOVE LINE! -->

The reprojection mode is configurable by setting [XRDisplaySubsystem.reprojectionMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRDisplaySubsystem-reprojectionMode.html) to the appropriate value.

For example, if you're building an [orientation-only experience](../../../../design/coordinate-systems.md#building-an-orientation-only-or-seated-scale-experience) with rigidly body-locked content (for example, 360-degree video content), you can explicitly set the reprojection mode to orientation only by setting it to [ReprojectionMode.OrientationOnly](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRDisplaySubsystem.ReprojectionMode.html).

# [Legacy WSA](#tab/wsa)
<!-- NEVER CHANGE THE ABOVE LINE! -->

The reprojection mode is configurable by setting [HolographicSettings.ReprojectionMode](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.WSA.HolographicSettings.ReprojectionMode.html) to the appropriate value.

For example, if you're building an [orientation-only experience](../../../../design/coordinate-systems.md#building-an-orientation-only-or-seated-scale-experience) with rigidly body-locked content (for example, 360-degree video content), you can explicitly set the reprojection mode to orientation only by setting it to [HolographicReprojectionMode.OrientationOnly](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.WSA.HolographicSettings.HolographicReprojectionMode.html).
