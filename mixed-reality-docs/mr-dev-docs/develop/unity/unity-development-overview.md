# Unity development for HoloLens

![Unity banner logo](../images/unity_logo_banner.png)

The fastest path to building a HoloLens [mixed reality app](../../design/app-views.md) in [Unity](https://unity.com) is with the Mixed Reality Toolkit. If you're brand new to Unity, we recommend that you explore the beginner level [tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) on the Unity Learn platform before continuing. It's also a good idea to visit the comprehensive [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com) and the [Unity Mixed Reality forums](https://forum.unity3d.com/forums/hololens.102/) to engage with the online community building mixed reality apps. You never know what cool assets or solutions you might find out in the wild. When you're ready to get started with MRTK head to the development checkpoints below!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take a look at our **[porting guides](../porting-apps/porting-overview.md)** if you have an existing Unity project that you want to bring over to HoloLens 2. We have guides for projects that are using HTK, MRTK v1, or SteamVR.

## Development checkpoints

Use the following checkpoints to bring your Unity games and applications into the world of mixed reality. If you haven't already explored the [Designing Holograms sample application](https://www.microsoft.com/p/designing-holograms/9nxwnjklrzwd), we recommend downloading and using it to familiarize yourself with the basics of Mixed Reality UX.

### 1. Getting started

The easiest way to develop in Unity is with the Mixed Reality Toolkit. MRTK will help you automatically setup a project for Mixed Reality and provide a set of features to accelerate your development process. By the end of this section, you'll have a basic understanding of the Mixed Reality Toolkit, a properly configured development environment for Mixed Reality apps, and a working MRTK project in Unity that you built yourself.

|  Checkpoint  |  Outcome  |
| --- | --- |
| [What is MRTK?](mrtk-getting-started.md) | Begin your journey by getting acquainted with the Mixed Reality Toolkit and what it has to offer |
| [Install the latest tools](../install-the-tools.md) | Download and install the latest Unity package and setup your project for mixed reality |
| [HoloLens 2 tutorial series](tutorials/mr-learning-base-01.md) | Dive into beginner level MRTK tutorials for HoloLens 2 hardware |
| **Optional** [Download the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](welcome-to-mr-feature-tool.md) | A new developer tool for discovering, updating, and adding Mixed Reality feature packages to your Unity projects |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you'd like to create a new Unity project without importing Mixed Reality Toolkit, there are a small set of Unity settings you'll need to manually change for Windows Mixed Reality. These are broken down into two categories: per-project and per-scene. Take a look at our [configuration guide](configure-unity-project.md) for the step-by-step process.

> [!NOTE]
> Once you've setup MRTK V2 in your project, standard Unity game objects like the camera will light up immediately for a seated-scale experience. You can find instructions on changing the experience scale of your application on the [coordinate systems](coordinate-systems-in-unity.md) page.

### 2. Core building blocks

All of the core building blocks for mixed reality applications are exposed in a manner consistent with other Unity APIs. These building blocks are available as standalone features and through the Mixed Reality Toolkit. You might not need all of them at once, but we recommend exploring early on. After diving into the core building blocks listed below, you'll have a toolbox full of features you can integrate into a Mixed Reality project by themselves or through MRTK.

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/unity-building-blocks.md)]

### 3. Advanced features

Other key features that play a role in mixed reality applications are available through Unity APIs without any extra packages or setup. These features can be added to Unity projects with or without MRTK installed. After diving into the more advanced capabilities that Unity offers, you'll be able to build deeper, complex Mixed Reality apps.

|  Feature  |  Capabilities  |
| --- | --- |
| [Shared experiences](shared-experiences-in-unity.md) | View and interact collectively with the same hologram at a fixed point in space using spatial anchor sharing |
| [Locatable camera](locatable-camera-in-unity.md) | Capture photos and video content in your Mixed Reality application |
| [Focus point](focus-point-in-unity.md) | Provide HoloLens a hint about how to best perform stabilization on the holograms currently being displayed |
| [Tracking loss](tracking-loss-in-unity.md) | Handle scenarios where your device can't locate itself in the applications world space |
| [Keyboard input](keyboard-input-in-unity.md) | Get input from real-world and Mixed Reality keyboards in your apps |

### 4. Deploying to a device or emulator

Once you've got your holographic Unity project ready for testing, your next step is to export and build a Unity Visual Studio solution. With that VS solution in hand, you can run your application in one of three ways on a real or simulated device. By the end of this section, you'll be able to deploy your application on whichever device or emulator fits your development needs.

* [HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-visual-studio.md)
* [HoloLens emulator](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-hololens-emulator.md)
* [Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset simulator](../platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-mixed-reality-simulator.md)

### 5. Adding services

At this point in your development journey you might be looking to add services or for a helping hand with commercial deployment. Integrating [Azure Cloud Services](../mixed-reality-cloud-services.md) and Dynamics 365 features can level up your projects in a major way. We've compiled a few starting points for you to explore and expand your Mixed Reality knowledge.

[!INCLUDE[](../includes/unity-cloud-services-d365.md)]

We also have a [comprehensive list of support documentation for additional Azure services](../mixed-reality-cloud-services.md#standalone-unity-services) that you can add to your Unity projects on a self-serve basis.

## What's next?

A developers job is never done, especially when learning a new tool or SDK. The following sections can take you into areas beyond the beginner level material you've already completed, along with helpful resources if you get stuck.
