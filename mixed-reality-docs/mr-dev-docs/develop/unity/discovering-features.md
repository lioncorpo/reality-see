## Refresh the feature catalog

To check for new and updated features, click the refresh ![refresh button](images/RefreshButton.png) button. This will connect to the catalog site and retrieve the latest information. Once the catalog has been read, the date and time of the last update will be displayed.

Each category with one or more selected features will update to display the count.

## Acquiring features

Once you've chosen your features, select **Get features** to start downloading the selected feature package files.

Once downloading is complete, the Mixed Reality Feature Tool will move to the [importing features](importing-features.md) step.

## Going back to the previous step

From **Discover features**, the Mixed Reality Feature Tool allows for navigating back to project selection. Select **Go back** to start again.
