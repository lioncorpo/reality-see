# Upgrading projects in Unreal

When updating to a new version of Unreal, deprecated functions show up as warnings when compiling blueprints or packaging the project.  Functions are deprecated when a new function has been added that should be used instead. 

## 4.26 upgrades
 
In 4.26, all AR and VR platforms have been refactored to add common interfaces and keep application code platform agnostic, so you may see more warnings than usual.  Updating to the new APIs is recommended so the project can be more easily ported to other platforms.

Warning messages will show which function has been deprecated and indicate what function to use instead.  All deprecated functions will continue to work for this release but may not work in future releases.  Deprecated functions will also no longer be listed when searching for functions in a blueprint.

## 4.26 changes

The significant change is that **Start in VR** from **Edit > Project Settings > Project > Description > Settings** is mandatory for starting Windows Mixed Reality plugin. Without that parameter, you will not see your holograms on the device.
