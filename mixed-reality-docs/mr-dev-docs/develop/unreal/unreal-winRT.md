# WinRT in Unreal

Over the course of your HoloLens development you may need to write a feature using WinRT. For example, opening a file dialogue in a HoloLens application would need the FileSavePicker in winrt/Windows.Storage.Pickers.h header file. WinRT is supported in Unreal's build system from version 4.26 onwards.

## Next Development Checkpoint

If you're following the Unreal development journey we've laid out, you're in the midst of exploring the Mixed Reality platform capabilities and APIs. From here, you can continue to any [topic](unreal-development-overview.md#3-platform-capabilities-and-apis) or jump directly to deploying your app on a device or emulator.
