|[The State of Mixed Reality--Where Companies are finding Success](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Docs-Mixed-Reality/The-State-of-Mixed-Reality-Where-Companies-are-finding-Success)|Ori Amiga & Matt Fleckenstein|Ultra-low latency edge computing, coupled with AI and mixed reality, is the foundation for the next generation of experiences. By blending the digital and the physical worlds into ubiquitous computing experiences, mixed reality is enabling possibilities we could have only dreamed of previously. In this session, Ori and Matt will provide unique insight into the mixed reality market opportunity today and in the future. They'll highlight how Microsoft is helping leading enterprises in manufacturing, health care and retail harness the power of mixed reality to drive business efficiency and transform customer and employee experiences.|
|[Fireside Chat](https://aka.ms/MRDDFireside)|Alex Kipman & René Schulte|Opening up day two we have invited Microsoft MVP, Regional Director, and community member extraordinaire René Schulte to stand around a fire and chat about the topics the community is interested in. René has been gathering questions from the community for about a week, and we anticipate it's going to be a great conversation.|
|[Designing AR/VR experiences using Microsoft Maquette](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Docs-Mixed-Reality/Designing-ARVR-experiences-using-Microsoft-Maquette)|Ricardo Acosta|Designing a phone app or a website has a well-defined workflow. Unfortunately, due to its novelty designing spatial reality experiences can be tricky if you use the same 2D workflow or toolset. Luckily, the new Microsoft Maquette app focuses on helping UX designers to design.|
|[MRTK Unity v2 & beyond - How community feedback helped us improve MRTK](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Docs-Mixed-Reality/MRTK-Unity-v2-and-beyond-How-community-feedback-helped-us-improve-MRTK)|Bernadette Thalhammer|A talk about how we've improved the developer experience over the last year by listening to feedback from the community and how developers can leverage these improvements.
