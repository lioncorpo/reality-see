We look forward to having you join us at Mixed Reality Dev Days! Get ready for a new event format, tailored to a digital experience in 2D and 3D with AltspaceVR, with opportunities to hear from Microsoft leaders, learn from experts, and connect with the mixed reality developer community. Register for the digital experience today, at no cost to you!

## Important Details

**Date - May 21 and 22**

**Location - AltspaceVR**

**Registration - FREE**

## Registration

[Register Now](https://mixedrealityprod.microsoftcrmportals.com/MRDDRegistration/)

We're excited to open up registration for Mixed Reality Dev Days, which is an event being held in AltspaceVR. However, we're still requesting that attendees register so we can send email updates as the event gets closer, and to make sure there's enough staff for the number of attendees.

## About Altspace

[AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/) is the premier place to attend live shows, meetups, cool classes, and more with friendly people from around the world. All thanks to the magic of Virtual Reality.  Altspace became part of the Microsoft family in 2017 and we're excited to showcase how events in virtual space can be run.

Altspace supports the following platforms: 

* HTC Vive
* Oculus Rift, Go, and Quest
* Samsung GearVR
* Windows Mixed Reality
* 2D Mode on PC.  

Mac users will need to use Parallels or Bootcamp to use Windows to access AltspaceVR.

### Creating an account

There are two ways to create an account:

- The most efficient way is to download the AltspaceVR client of choice for your setup, complete the install, and then launch the client. Once you're in the program, there will be an option to create an account.  Minimum system specifications can be found [here](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003538414-Minimum-System-Specifications).

- The other option is to visit up the Online account sign](https://account.altvr.com/users/sign_up).

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues with Altspace, check the [troubleshooting page](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000792634-Troubleshooting). If that doesn't solve the issue you're experiencing, file a [support request](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### Extra tips

- If this is your first time using AltspaceVR, please give yourself time before the first event to go through the tutorial.
- (Optionally) we recommend attending one of the AltspaceVR 101 events for more tips and tricks.
- Favorite/Register Interest before the event to easily find it later in the client.
- Unlike other virtual meetings, AltspaceVR is an immersive environment and as such, you can block other attendees view. Respect other attendees space and view to ensure everyone has a good experience.
- Friend everyone you want to talk to at the event. You can invite friends back to your AltspaceVR home to chat privately if you wish.
- If you stand near a microphone, your voice will be broadcast to everyone at the event! So take care when you're talking.

## Schedule - Subject to change

**All times are Pacific Daylight Time** 

### Networking space

We have a networking space that will be opening after the Keynote on day one, after the Fireside chat on day two, and will remain open until 4pm Pacific time every day. If you would like the "RSVP" for this space, you can do so [here](https://account.altvr.com/events/1472955760198550135). The idea of the networking space is similar to the "hallway track" at a physical conference.  A place to meet up with fellow developers, designers, enthusiasts, and even Microsoft staff.
