# Azure mixed reality services
Unlock what every human is an expert at—the three-dimensional, physical world around us—with Azure mixed reality services. Help people create, learn, and collaborate more effectively with digital information capture and surfacing. Bring 3D to mobile devices, headsets, and other untethered devices. Using Azure, help ensure that your most sensitive information is protected.

## Multi-user, spatially aware applications using Spatial Anchors

Build multi-user, spatially aware mixed reality applications using Spatial Anchors. Create mixed reality apps that map, designate, and recall precise points of interest accessible across HoloLens, iOS, and Android devices. Enable wayfinding across spaces to help your users collaborate more efficiently.

## Interactive, high-quality 3D models using Remote Rendering

In scenarios were every detail matters—industrial plant management, design review for assets like truck engines, pre-operative surgery planning, and more—3D visualization brings that detail to life. It's what helps designers, engineers, doctors, and students understand complex information and make the right call.

If you're running high-quality 3D models on mobile devices and mixed reality headsets today, you need to simplify 3D models enough to run on target hardware. This simplification can result in a loss of important detail that's needed in key business and design decisions.

Azure Remote Rendering Preview brings interactive, high-quality 3D models to untethered devices with every detail intact and no quality compromises.
