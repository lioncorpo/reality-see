## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is built to be cross MR/AR/VR/XR platform by design. The toolkit currently supports Unity 2019.4.x and Unity 2018.4.x.

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. Although the Mixed Reality Toolkit runs on the latest non-beta (ex: 2020.1) tech branch version of Unity, it is not officially supported.

### 2.6.0

For the latest status of the release, please visit the [milestone page]( https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/13).

Status: In development

Target Timeline: January 2021

Themes:

- Stability
- User Experience
- Platform Expansion: OpenXR
- Developer Education
- Packaging

**Stability**

Quality and stability are the top priority for this and all Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit releases. We will continue to prioritize customer and partner issues that impact the stability of MRTK components.

**User Experience**

We're listening to your feedback about MRTK and have continued plans for:

- Bug fixes
- Making MRTK UX controls easier to understand
- HoloLens Shell parity
- Tests to ensure features do not regress

**Platform Expansion: OpenXR**

The MRTK team supports the open future of mixed reality through [OpenXR](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/moving-forward-to-openxr/ba-p/1825672). Support for OpenXR is currently under development.

**Developer Education**

[Developer documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and example scenes are an ongoing priority for the MRTK team.

With continued investments in [MRTK tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/tutorials), the MRTK team seeks to accelerate the getting started experience for developers and improve instructions on how to leverage Azure Services and other extensions with the MRTK.

**Packaging**

In MRTK 2.5.0 we released support for Unity Package Manager (UPM). We are continuing to make improvements so it's even easier for you to download packages with UPM.

## Backlog

The following list highlights some of the key investments the MRTK team intends to pursue.

- Platform expansion
- Extensibility
- Modularity
- Accessibility features
- Globalization enhancements
- Cloud service support
