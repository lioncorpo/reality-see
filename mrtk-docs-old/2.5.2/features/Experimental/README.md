# What is the Mixed Reality Toolkit

![Mixed Reality Toolkit](../images/Logo_MRTK_Unity_Banner.png)

MRTK-Unity is a Microsoft-driven project that provides a set of components and features, used to accelerate cross-platform MR app development in Unity. Here are some of its functions:

* Provides the **cross-platform input system and building blocks for spatial interactions and UI**.
* Enables **rapid prototyping** via in-editor simulation that allows you to see changes immediately.
* Operates as an **extensible framework** that provides developers the ability to swap out core components.
* **Supports a wide range of platforms**, including
  * Microsoft HoloLens
  * Microsoft HoloLens 2
  * Windows Mixed Reality headsets
  * OpenVR headsets (HTC Vive / Oculus Rift)
  * Ultraleap Hand Tracking
  * Mobile devices such as iOS and Android

## Getting started with MRTK

If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development in Unity, **we recommend you start at the beginning of our** [Unity development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unity-development-overview?tabs=mrtk%2Chl2) in the Microsoft Docs. The Unity development journey is specifically tailored to walk new developers through the installation, core concepts, and usage of MRTK.

| IMPORTANT: The Unity development journey currently uses **MRTK version 2.4.0** and **Unity 2019.4**. |

## MRTK examples hub

With the MRTK Examples Hub, you can try various example scenes in MRTK.
You can find pre-built app packages for HoloLens(x86), HoloLens 2(ARM), and Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets(x64) under [**Release Assets**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.4.0) folder. [Use the Windows Device Portal to install apps on HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-install-apps#use-the-windows-device-portal-to-install-apps-on-hololens). On HoloLens 2, you can download and install [MRTK Examples Hub through the Microsoft Store app](https://www.microsoft.com/p/mrtk-examples-hub/9mv8c39l2sj4).

See [Examples Hub README page](../example-scenes/ExampleHub.md) to learn about the details on creating a multi-scene hub with MRTK's scene system and scene transition service.
