# What is the Mixed Reality Toolkit

![Mixed Reality Toolkit](features/images/Logo_MRTK_Unity_Banner.png)

MRTK-Unity is a Microsoft-driven project that provides a set of components and features, used to accelerate cross-platform MR app development in Unity. Here are some of its functions:

* Provides the **cross-platform input system and building blocks for spatial interactions and UI**.
* Enables **rapid prototyping** via in-editor simulation that allows you to see changes immediately.
* Operates as an **extensible framework** that provides developers the ability to swap out core components.
* **Supports a wide range of platforms**, including
  * OpenXR (Unity 2020.2 or newer)
    * Microsoft HoloLens 2
    * Windows Mixed Reality headsets
  * Windows Mixed Reality
    * Microsoft HoloLens
    * Microsoft HoloLens 2
    * Windows Mixed Reality headsets
  * Oculus (Unity 2019.3 or newer)
    * Oculus Quest
  * OpenVR
    * Windows Mixed Reality headsets
    * HTC Vive
    * Oculus Rift
  * Ultraleap Hand Tracking
  * Mobile devices such as iOS and Android

## Getting started with MRTK

If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development in Unity, **we recommend you start at the beginning of our** [Unity development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unity-development-overview?tabs=mrtk%2Chl2) in the Microsoft Docs. The Unity development journey is specifically tailored to walk new developers through the installation, core concepts, and usage of MRTK.

| IMPORTANT: The Unity development journey currently uses **MRTK version 2.4.0** and **Unity 2019.4**. |
