# Mixed Reality Toolkit packages

The Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit is provided as a collection of packages. The contents of these packages is described in the following sections.

- [Foundation](#foundation)
- [Extensions](#extensions)
- [Tools](#tools)
- [Examples](#examples)

## Foundation

The Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation package includes the core components required to create a mixed reality application.

| | OpenVR | Support for OpenVR devices. |
| | [UnityAR](../features/CameraSystem/UnityArCameraSettings.md) | (Experimental) Camera settings provider enabling MRTK use with mobile AR devices. |
| | WindowsMixedReality | Support for Windows Mixed Reality devices, including Microsoft HoloLens and immersive headsets. |
| | WindowsVoiceInput | Support for speech and dictation on Microsoft Windows platforms. |
| | XRSDK | (Experimental) Support for [Unity's new XR framework](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/01/24/unity-xr-platform-updates/) in Unity 2019.3. |
| MRTK/SDK | | |
| | Experimental | Experimental features, including shaders, user interface controls and individual system managers. |
| | Features | Functionality that builds upon the Foundation package. |
| | Profiles | Default profiles for the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit systems and services. |

| | [SceneSystem](../features/SceneSystem/SceneSystemGettingStarted.md) | System providing multi-scene application support. |
| | [SpatialAwarenessSystem](../features/SpatialAwareness/SpatialAwarenessGettingStarted.md) | System providing support for awareness of the user's environment. |
| | [TeleportSystem](../features/TeleportSystem/Overview.md) | System providing support for teleporting (moving about the experience in jumps). |

## Extensions

The optional Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Extensions package includes additional services that extend the functionality of the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit.

> [!NOTE]
> The extensions package requires Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation.

## Tools

The optional Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Tools package includes helpful tools that enhance the mixed reality development experience using the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit.
These tools are located in the **Mixed Reality Toolkit > Utilities** menu in the Unity Editor.

> [!NOTE]
> The tools package requires Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation.

| Folder | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MRTK/Tools | |

| | ScreenshotUtility | Enables capturing application images in the Unity editor. |
| | TextureCombinerWindow | Utility to combine graphics textures. |

## Examples

The optional Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Examples package includes demonstration projects that illustrate the features of the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples package requires Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation.

| Folder | Component | Description |
