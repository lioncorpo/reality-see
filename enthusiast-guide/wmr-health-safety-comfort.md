# Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset health, safety, and comfort

## To view 3D content more comfortably

Good binocular vision is required to view stereoscopic 3D content. If you have a binocular vision disorder, such as strabismus (eye misalignment, crossed or wandering eye), viewing 3D content won't be comfortable. A small percentage of people have a pre-existing binocular vision disorder that they might not be aware of until they try viewing 3D content. Consider consulting an eye doctor if you aren't able to view 3D content clearly and comfortably.

## WARNING

Follow all setup, user guidelines, and instructions provided by the Windows Mixed Reality headset and motion controller manufacturers (each **Device**), and the publisher of any software application or 2D or 3D content or experience (**Content**).

Failure to set up, use, and properly care for your Device can increase the risk of serious injury, death, property damage, or damage to the product or related accessories.

**If you let anyone else use your Device**, make sure they understand the health and safety information in this guide, and any other safety or usage instructions provided by the Device and Content providers. Each person using the Device should complete the set up/orientation procedures to become familiar with the system.

## Use in safe surroundings

Using your Device can distract you and keep you from seeing your surroundings. Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets may fully obstruct your view, and Content may appear at a distance but still block your view of nearby physical objects.

Use only in a safe place that is appropriate for your activities. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged, and so on, and situations in which people or things might unexpectedly approach. Don't use your Device when a view of your surroundings and attention is needed for safety.

Follow all setup recommendations for Windows Mixed Reality, including using your headset to create a boundary. Your PC setup and some applications or experiences may result in delays or errors in the boundary display. Always use caution and be aware of your surroundings, even if you've created a boundary.

## Using Windows Mixed Reality comfortably

**Some people may experience discomfort** such as nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, or eye strain when using Windows Mixed Reality, particularly as they adjust to using it. Motion sickness and related symptoms can occur when there's a mismatch between what you see and what your body perceives. If you're prone to motion sickness, get migraine headaches, have an inner ear disorder, or other health conditions, you may be at increased risk of discomfort.

**Certain situations can increase your risk of discomfort.** For example:

* Being a new user - symptoms tend to lessen as you become accustomed to Windows Mixed Reality.
* Devices may work best for users whose interpupillary distance (IPD) falls within a certain range. IPD is the distance between the center of the pupils of the two eyes. Users with an IPD outside the optimal range for the Device may experience discomfort.
* Certain types of content, particularly games, or movies that make you feel as if you're moving through space or looking down from above, or interactions that involve tracking moving objects.
* Using the Device for extended periods without a break.

**Keep your first sessions brief**. Start slowly. For most people discomfort should lessen over the first few sessions.

**Take breaks periodically** and stop and rest if you experience any discomfort. The timing and length of breaks may depend on the individual user and how they're using the Device.

**If you experience discomfort**, stop using the Device and rest until you feel better. Sitting still in a well-lit environment can help speed recovery from disorientation. If you feel disoriented, avoid activities that require balance, coordination, or other capabilities until you recover. Take note of the type of content you were viewing and other aspects of the situation in which the discomfort occurred, so you can adjust or ease into the situation next time. People differ in the time they take to adapt. Consider taking more frequent or longer breaks.

**To aid in managing your surroundings**, if available and configured, features of the device can be used to set up boundaries for Device use to help you avoid obstacles.
