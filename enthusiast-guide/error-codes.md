|   1-4 <br/><br/> 2197815297-4  | **Check your headset display cable to make sure it is plugged in correctly.** <br/><br/><ol start="1"><li>Unplug and replug the headset USB and display cables.</li><li>Check **Device Manager > Monitors** to see if the "Mixed Reality headset" monitor is present.</li><li>Check that your graphics drivers are current on the graphics card manufacturer's website.</li><li>If you're using an adapter to connect your headset, make sure it [supports Windows Mixed Reality](./recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md).</li><li>If your graphics card has both DisplayPort and HDMI ports, use the DisplayPort port on your graphics card and use a supported Mixed Reality DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter.</li><li>Try a different USB 3.0 port on your PC.</li></ol> |
|   1-5 <br/><br/> 2197815297-5  | **Check your display cable: Your headset displays failed to initialize properly. Try restarting your PC and reconnecting your headset.**<br/><br/>Windows sees your headset monitor, but Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble communicating with the Mixed Reality headset display. To fix this:<br/><ol start="1"><li>Check that your graphics drivers are current on the graphics card manufacturer's website.</li><li>If you're using an adapter to connect your headset, make sure it [supports Windows Mixed Reality](./recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md).</li><li>If your graphics card has both DisplayPort and HDMI ports, use the DisplayPort port on your graphics card, and use a supported Mixed Reality DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter.</li><li>Try restarting your PC.</li></ol> |

|   7-1, 7-2, 7-3  <br/><br/> 2181038087-1 2181038087-2 2181038087-3  | **Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble connecting to your headset. Try unplugging your headset and plugging it back in.**<br/><br/>The Mixed Reality headset failed to completely initialize. This is most likely a transient error. Unplug your headset and plug it back in.
|   7-4  <br/><br/> 2181038087-4  | **Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble connecting to your headset. Try unplugging your headset and plugging it back in.**<br/><br/>The Mixed Reality headset driver failed to initialize the tracking cameras on your headset. This is most likely a transient error. Unplug your headset and plug it back in.
|   7-5  <br/><br/> 2181038087-5  | **Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble connecting to your headset. Try plugging your headset into a different USB port and temporarily unplugging any other USB devices connected to your PC.**<br/><br/>Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble getting sensor data from the Mixed Reality device. This could be a transient error, or USB signal integrity issues. Make sure you're using a quality power USB hub. If the problem persists:</li><li>Temporarily unplug all of your USB devices and peripherals, remove all extension cables, and plug in just your headset.</li><li>Disable any USB suspend or power-saving features on your PC. This includes Selective suspend in Windows power options, the "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" setting in Device Manager, and any USB power-saving settings in your PC's firmware.</li></ul>
|   7-6  <br/><br/> 2181038087-6  | **There is a problem with your headset firmware. Try unplugging your headset and plugging it back in.** <br/><br/>This can be transient error.

|   7-7  <br/><br/> 2181038087-7  | **Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble connecting to your headset. Try plugging your headset into a different USB port and temporarily unplugging any other USB devices connected to your PC.**<br/><br/>The Mixed Reality headset driver failed to initialize the firmware on your headset. This can be transient error. Try unplugging and replugging in your headset and make sure you're using a quality power USB hub. If that doesn't work:<li>Temporarily unplug USB devices and peripherals you don't need to run Windows Mixed Reality.</li><li>Remove all extension cables.</li><li>Check Windows Updates to ensure you're running the latest available headset driver.</li></ul>
|   7-11  <br/><br/> 2181038087-11 | **Your CPU is too old to be compatible with Windows Mixed Reality.**<br/><br/>Your CPU is missing the AVX instruction set required by the Mixed Reality motion controllers. You'll need a [Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-all-devices?col=wmr-pcs#icons).
|   7-12  <br/><br/> 2181038087-12 | **Your headset is connected to an incompatible USB controller. Try plugging your headset into a different USB port, if available. Or, try installing a Microsoft USB driver in place of any incompatible drivers.**<br/><br/>Your headset may be plugged in to a USB port connected to an incompatible non-Microsoft USB controller driver. These USB 3.0 controller drivers are often missing the ability to read and handle the [ContainerID descriptor](/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-containerids-in-windows), which aggregates the different parts of the Mixed Reality headset into a cohesive unit (to play audio out of the correct headphones, video out the correct displays, and pull tracking data from the correct sensors). To change your USB controller driver: <ol start="1"><li>Launch Device Manager.</li><li>Expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers" and right-click to uninstall the driver for each item that includes the text "eXtensible Host Controller" **and** doesn't have "Microsoft" in the name.</li><li>Select "Delete the driver software for this device" to ensure the old drivers are removed.</li><li>Verify each item that includes the text "eXtensible Host Controller" has "Microsoft" at the end.</li><li>Plug in the headset.</li></ol>If the issue is intermittent, the headset might not be properly responding to commands from the headset driver. To fix the issue, unplug the headset for 30 or more seconds, then plug it back in. |
|   7-13  <br/><br/> 2181038087-13 | **Your headset is connected to an incompatible USB controller. Try plugging your headset into a different USB port, if available. If not, you'll need to install a new USB 3.0 controller.**<br/><br/>Windows Mixed Reality is unable to synchronize the Mixed Reality camera frame timestamps to your PC timestamps. This is most likely caused by an incompatible USB 3.0 host controller that doesn't support ITP (Isochronous Timestamp Packets). Contact your PC manufacturer to see if ITP can be enabled, or switch to another USB Host controller with ITP support. |
|   7-14  <br/><br/> 2181038087-14 | **Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble connecting to your headset. Try unplugging your headset and plugging it back in.**<br/><br/>Windows Mixed Reality is having trouble initializing the presence sensor on your Mixed Reality headset. In Device Manager, the headset will show the error message "PoseThread failed to initialize presence sensor". To fix:<br/><ol start="1"><li>Unplug your headset, then plug it back in. Make sure the USB cable is plugged in all the way.</li><li>Try another USB port on your PC.</li><li>Try your headset on another PC to see if the headset enumerates completely in Device Manager on that PC.</li><li>Check if your PC has any other conflicting HID drivers installed, for example, from your keyboard or mouse. Look for any HID devices in Device Manager with a question-mark logo on them.</li><li>If you're using a Samsung Mixed Reality headset running Windows 10 Version 1709 or Version 1803, follow the instructions for error code 2181038087-12 to check if your USB 3.0 controller is running a non-Microsoft USB controller driver.</li></ol> |
|   7-15  <br/><br/> 2181038087-15 | **Windows Mixed Reality has detected an incompatible WinUSB driver installed.**<br/><br/><ol start="1"><li>Ensure the WinUSB driver on your PC is the one that comes with Windows, and that third-party USB drivers have not overwritten the copy of WinUSB on your PC.</li><li>You may need to recover or reinstall your Windows installation if the problem persists.</li></ol> |
