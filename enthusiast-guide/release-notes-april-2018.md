## New features for Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets

The Windows 10 April 2018 Update includes many improvements for using Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets with your desktop PC, such as: 

* **New environments for the mixed reality home** - Choose between the Cliff House and the new Skyloft environment by selecting **Places** on the Start menu. We've also added [an experimental feature](/windows/mixed-reality/design/add-custom-home-environments) that will let you use custom environments you've created.
* **Quick access to mixed reality capture** - Take mixed reality photos using a motion controller across environments and apps, but won't capture content protected with DRM. Hold the Windows button and then tap the trigger. .
* **New options for launching and resizing content** - Apps are now automatically placed in front of you when you launch them from the Start menu. You can also now resize 2D apps by dragging the edges and corners of the window.
* **Easily jump to content with "teleport" voice command** - Quickly teleport in front of content in the Windows Mixed Reality home by gazing at content and saying "teleport."
* **[Animated 3D app launchers](/windows/mixed-reality/distribute/creating-3d-models-for-use-in-the-windows-mixed-reality-home#animation-guidelines) and [decorative 3D objects](/windows/mixed-reality/distribute/enable-placement-of-3d-models-in-the-home) for the mixed reality home**. You can now add animation to 3D app launchers and allow users to place decorative 3D models from a webpage or 2D app into the Windows Mixed Reality home.
* **[Improvements to Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/porting-apps/updating-your-steamvr-application-for-windows-mixed-reality)** - Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR is out of "early access" with new upgrades, including: haptic feedback when using motion controllers, improved performance and reliability, and improvements to the appearance of motion controllers in SteamVR.
* **Other improvements** - Updated automatic performance settings provide a more optimized experience (you can [manually override](#visual-quality) this setting). Setup now provides more detailed information about common compatibility issues with USB 3.0 controllers and graphics cards.

## New features for HoloLens

The Windows 10 April 2018 Update has arrived for all HoloLens customers! This update is packed with improvements introduced since the last major release of HoloLens software in [August 2016](release-notes-august-2016.md).

### For everyone

<table>

    <th>Feature</th><th>Details</th><th>Instructions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Auto-placement of 2D and 3D content on launch</td><td>A 2D app launcher or 2D UWP app auto-places in the world at an optimal size and distance when launched instead of requiring the user to place it. If an <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/design/app-views">immersive app</a> uses a 2D app launcher instead of a <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/distribute/3d-app-launcher-design-guidance">3D app launcher</a>, the immersive app will auto-launch from the 2D app launcher same as in RS1.<br><br>A 3D app launcher from the Start menu also auto-places in the world. Instead of auto-launching the app, users can then click on the launcher to launch the immersive app. 3D content opened from the Holograms app and from Edge also auto-places in the world.</td><td>When opening an app from the Start menu, you won't be asked to place it in the world.<br><br>If the 2D app/<a href="/windows/mixed-reality/distribute/3d-app-launcher-design-guidance">3D app launcher</a> placement isn't optimal, you can easily move them using new fluid app manipulations described below. You can also reposition the 2D app launcher/3D content by saying "Move this" and then using gaze to reposition the content.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fluid app manipulation</td><td>Move, resize, and rotate 2D and 3D content without having to enter "Adjust" mode.</td><td>To move a 2D UWP app or 2D app launcher, simply gaze at its app bar and then use the tap + hold + drag gesture. You can move 3D content by gazing anywhere on the object and then using tap + hold + drag.<br><br>To resize 2D content, gaze at its corner. The gaze cursor will turn into a resize cursor, and then you can tap + hold + drag to resize. You can also make 2D content taller or wider by looking at its edges and dragging.<br><br>To resize 3D content, lift up both your hands into gesture frame, fingers up in the ready position. You'll see the cursor turn into a state with 2 little hands. Do the tap and hold gesture with both your hands. Moving your hands closer or farther apart  change the size of the object.

## Known issues

We've worked hard to deliver a great Windows Mixed Reality experience, but we're still tracking some known issues. If you find others, please [give us feedback](/windows/mixed-reality/give-us-feedback).

### HoloLens

#### After update

You may notice the following issues after updating from RS1 to RS4 on your HoloLens:
* **Pins reset** - The 3x3 apps pinned to your Start menu will be reset to the defaults after update. 
* **Apps and placed holograms reset** - Apps placed in your world will be removed after the update and will need to be re-placed throughout your space. 
* **Feedback Hub may not launch immediately** - Immediately after update, it will take a few minutes before you're able to launch some inbox apps such as Feedback Hub, while they update themselves. 
* **Corporate Wi-Fi certificates need to be re-synced** - We're investigating an issue that requires the HoloLens to be connected to a different network in order for corporate certificates to be re-synced to the device before it can reconnect to corporate networks using certificates. 
* **H.265 HEVC Video Playback doesn't work** - Applications that attempt to play back H.265 videos will receive an error message. The workaround is to [access the Windows Device Portal](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal), select **Apps** on the left navigation bar, and **remove** the HEVC application. Then, install the latest [HEVC Video Extension](https://www.microsoft.com/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7) from the Microsoft Store. We're investigating the issue. 

#### For developers: updating HoloLens apps for devices running Windows 10 April 2018 Update

Along with a great list of [new features](#new-features-for-hololens), the Windows 10 April 2018 Update (RS4) for HoloLens enforces some code behaviors that previous versions didn't:
* **Permission requests to use sensitive resources (camera, microphone, and so on)** - RS4 on HoloLens will enforce permission requests for apps intending to access sensitive resources, such as the camera or microphone. RS1 on HoloLens didn't force these prompts, so, if your app assumes immediate access to these resources, it may crash in RS4 (even if the user grants permission to the requested resource). Read the relevant [UWP app capability declarations article](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations) for more information.
* **Calls to apps outside your own** - RS4 on HoloLens will enforce proper use of the [*Windows.System.Launcher* class](/uwp/api/Windows.System.Launcher) to launch another app from your own. For example, we've seen issues with apps calling *Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriForResultsAsync* from a non-ASTA (UI) thread. This would succeed in RS1 on HoloLens, but RS4 requires the call to be executed on the UI thread.

### Windows Mixed Reality on Desktop

#### Visual quality

* If you notice after the Windows 10 April 2018 Update that graphics are more blurry than before, or that the field of view looks smaller on your headset, the automatic performance setting may have been changed to maintain a sufficient framerate on a less powerful graphics card (such as Nvidia 1050). You can manually override this (if you choose) by navigating to **Settings > Mixed reality > Headset display > Experience options > Change** and changing "Automatic" to "90 Hz." You can also try changing **Visual quality** (on the same Settings page) to "High."

#### Windows Mixed Reality setup

* When setting up Windows with a headset connected, your PC monitor may go blank. Unplug your headset to enable output to your PC monitor to complete Windows setup.
* If you don't have headphones connected, you may miss tips when you first visit the Windows Mixed Reality home.
* Other Bluetooth devices can cause interference with motion controllers. If the motion controllers have connection/pairing/tracking issues, make sure the Bluetooth radio (if an external dongle) is plugged in to an unobstructed location and not immediately next to another Bluetooth dongle. Also try powering down other Bluetooth peripherals during Windows Mixed Reality sessions to see if it helps.

#### Games and apps from the Microsoft Store

* Some graphically intensive games, like Forza Motorsport 7, may cause performance issues on less capable PCs when played inside Windows Mixed Reality.

#### Audio

* If Cortana is enabled on your host PC before you use your Windows Mixed Reality headset, you may lose spatial sound simulation applied to the apps you place around the Windows Mixed Reality home. 
   * The work-around is to enable "Windows Sonic for Headphones" on all the audio devices attached to your PC, even your headset-connected audio device:
      1. Left-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select from list of audio devices.
      2. Right-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select "Windows Sonic for Headphones" in the "Speaker setup" menu.
      3. Repeat these steps for all of your audio devices (endpoints).
   * Another option is turning off "Let Cortana respond to Hey Cortana" in **Settings** > **Cortana** on your desktop before launching Windows Mixed Reality.
* When another multimedia USB device (such as a web cam) shares the same USB hub (either external or inside your PC) with the Windows Mixed Reality headset, in rare cases the headset's audio jack/headphones may either have a buzzing sound or no audio at all. You can fix this by your headset into a USB port that doesn't share the same hub as the other device, or disconnect/disable your other USB multimedia device.
* In rare cases, the host PC's USB hub can't provide enough power to the Windows Mixed Reality headset and you may notice a burst of noise from the headphones connected to the headset.

#### Holograms

* If you've placed a large number of holograms in your Windows Mixed Reality home, some may disappear and reappear as you look around. To avoid this, remove some of the holograms in that area of the Windows Mixed Reality home.

#### Motion controllers

* If input isn't being routed to the headset, the motion controller will briefly disappear when being held next to the room boundary. Pressing Win+Y to ensure there's a blue banner across the Desktop monitor will resolve this. 
* Occasionally, when you click on a web page in Microsoft Edge, the content will zoom instead of click.

#### Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home

* Snipping Tool doesn't work in Desktop app.
* Desktop app doesn't persist setting on relaunch.
* If you're using Mixed Reality Portal preview on your desktop, when opening the Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home, you may notice the infinite mirror effect. 
* Running the Desktop app may cause performance issues on non-Ultra Windows Mixed Reality PCs; it isn't recommended.  
* Desktop app may auto-launch because an invisible window on Desktop has focus. 
* Desktop User Account Control prompt will make headset display black until the prompt is completed.

#### Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR

* You may need to launch Mixed Reality Portal after updating to ensure the necessary software updates for the Windows 10 April 2018 Update have completed before launching SteamVR. 
* You must be on a recent version of Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR to remain compatible with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Make sure automatic updates are turned on for Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR, which is located in the "Software" section of your library in Steam.  

#### Other issues

>[!IMPORTANT]
>An early version of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update pushed to Insiders (version 17134.5) was missing a piece of software necessary to run Windows Mixed Reality. We recommend avoiding this version if using Windows Mixed Reality. 

We've identified a performance regression when using Surface Book 2 on the initial release of this update (10.0.17134.1) that we're working to fix in an upcoming update patch. We suggest waiting until this has been fixed before updating manually or waiting for the update to roll out normally.

## Provide feedback and report issues

Use the [Feedback Hub app on your HoloLens or Windows 10 PC](/windows/mixed-reality/give-us-feedback) to provide feedback and report issues. Using Feedback Hub ensures that all necessary diagnostics information is included to help our engineers quickly debug and resolve the problem.

>[!NOTE]
>Be sure to accept the prompt that asks whether youâ€™d like Feedback Hub to access your Documents folder (select **Yes** when prompted).
