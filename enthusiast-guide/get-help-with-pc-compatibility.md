### This PC has an integrated graphics card with single-channel RAM

Integrated graphics cards will provide the best Windows Mixed Reality experience on PCs with dual-channel RAM. If you run into performance problems:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install a [compatible discrete graphics card](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#compatibility-guidelines)
> * Install an additional RAM stick to create dual-channel RAM
> * Switch to a [compatible PC](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#compatibility-guidelines)

### This PC has a hybrid graphics configuration with an incompatible PCIe link

PCIe stands for *Peripheral Component Interconnect Express*, which is the connection that a PC uses to communicate with a graphics card. Your configuration might work, but if you run into problems you'll need to switch to a [compatible PC](https://www.microsoft.com/mixed-reality/windows-mixed-reality?rtc=1).

### This PC's graphics driver might not work well with Windows Mixed Reality

Try downloading a new graphics driver using Windows Update by:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Selecting **Start > Settings > Update & security > Check for updates** or going to your PC or graphics card manufacturer's website
> * [Check for updates](ms-settings:windowsupdate?activationSource=SMC-Article-4045777)

If that doesn't work, you'll need to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add a [compatible graphics card](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#compatibility-guidelines) 
> * Switch to a [compatible PC](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#compatibility-guidelines)

### This PC's processor might not work well with Windows Mixed Reality

Your PC's processor might not work well with Windows Mixed Reality because it doesn't have enough cores. If Windows Mixed Reality doesn't run well:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Replace the processor with a [compatible one](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md) 
> * Switch to a [compatible PC](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#compatibility-guidelines)

### This PC might not have a compatible USB configuration

For problems running Windows Mixed Reality:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Check our [recommended adapters documentation](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md) for solutions to common compatibility issues
> * Consider using an [external powered USB hub](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md#using-external-usb-30-hubs-with-windows-mixed-reality-headsets)

If the problems persist:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Plug your headset into a different USB port, if you have one available.
> * If that doesn't work, uninstall your PC's current USB driver, and then reinstall a Microsoft driver:

1. Select **Start**, and then type "device manager" in the **Search** box.
2. Select **Device Manager** from the results.
3. Expand the category for Universal Serial Bus controllers, look at the devices listed, and uninstall any incompatible drivers.
    * If the list includes an “eXtensible Host Controller” item that doesn't have “Microsoft” at the end of the device name, that driver isn't compatible with Windows Mixed Reality. You’ll need to uninstall it. To uninstall a driver, right-click the device in the list and select **Uninstall device**. Select the **Delete the driver software for this device** check box, then select **Uninstall**.
    * If the list includes an "eXtensible Host Controller" item that includes "Etron" in the name, that USB controller isn't compatible with Windows Mixed Reality. You'll need to use a different USB port on the PC or purchase a different USB 3.0 host controller.
4. Restart your PC.
5. Return to Device Manager and locate the eXtensible Host Controller item again. If you now see “Microsoft” at the end of the device name, you’re good to go. If not, repeat the uninstall steps to remove any extra non-Microsoft versions of the driver.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * If that still doesn't work, add a PCIe USB card to your PC.

### This PC doesn't have Bluetooth 4.0 for controllers

2018 and newer Windows Mixed Reality headsets already have the built-in Bluetooth, but if you have older headset, bluetooth 4.0 is required for mixed reality motion controllers.
