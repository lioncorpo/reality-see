# Mixed Reality Portal error messages

## I got a "Something went wrong" error message, or I'm having problems in the Mixed Reality Portal.

Restart Windows Mixed Reality:
1. Disconnect both headset cables from your PC.
2. Restart your PC.
3. Reconnect your headset.

If that doesn't work, make sure that your PC recognizes your headset:
1. Select Start.
2. Type "device manager" in the search box and select it in the list. 
3. Expand "Mixed reality devices" and see if your headset is listed. 

If it isn't listed:
1. Plug the headset into different ports on the PC, if available.
2. Check for the latest software updates from Windows Update.
3. Uninstall and reinstall Windows Mixed Reality:
    1. Disconnect both headset cables from your PC.
    2. Select **Settings  > Mixed reality > Uninstall**.
    3. Select **Settings  > Devices  > Bluetooth & other devices** to unpair your motion controllers. Select each controller, and then select "Remove device".
    4. Plug your headset back into your PC to reinstall Windows Mixed Reality.
    
## I'm getting a "Check your USB cable" error message.

Connect your headset to a different USB port (and make sure it’s a SuperSpeed USB 3.0). Also, try removing any extenders or hubs between the headset and the computer.

## I'm getting a "Check your display cable" error message.

Use the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:
* Connect your headset to a DisplayPort 1.2 or later, or HDMI 1.4 or later. Make sure the port corresponds with the most advanced graphics card on your PC.
* If you’re using an adapter, make sure its 4K capable.
* Try using a different HDMI port.
* If you have an external monitor plugged into an HDMI port, try plugging it into a DisplayPort instead, and use the HDMI port for your headset.
