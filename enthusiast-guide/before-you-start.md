# Before you start

## What you'll need to run Windows Mixed Reality

* A Windows [Mixed Reality head mounted display (HMD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality-devices).
* A new [Windows Mixed Reality ready PC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039260/windows-10-mixed-reality-pc-hardware-guidelines) or a Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC running Windows 10 Version 1709 or later.
* An internet connection
* Display, USB, and Bluetooth adapters (if not built into headset or computer)
* Either motion controllers, an Xbox controller, or a mouse and keyboard
* Headphones with a microphone (if your HMD doesn't have them built in)
* A large, open space

## Make sure your PC is compatible with Windows Mixed Reality

Check the [Windows Mixed Reality minimum PC hardware requirements](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md) or run the [Windows Mixed Reality Portal](install-windows-mixed-reality.md#launch-mixed-reality-portal) on your PC to check Windows Mixed Reality compatibility.

Read up on [PC compatibility issues](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4045777/windows-10-get-help-with-pc-compatibility-in-windows-mixed-reality) for more details.

## Make sure you have the Windows 10 Version 1709 or newer installed

You must be running the Windows 10 Version 1903 or newer to use Windows Mixed Reality. Compatible versions of Windows 10 include:

* Windows 10 Version 1903
* Windows 10 Version 1909
* Windows 10 Version 2004
* Windows 10 Version 20H2

To see which version of Windows 10 your device is currently running, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings  > System > About**.

To ensure that Windows 10 is up to date on your PC, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings > Update & security > Windows Update**.  Select **Check for updates**. If updates are available, install them.

Check out [keeping your PC up to date](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq) for more information.

## Make sure your PC is connected to the internet

Check that your PC is connected to the Internet and download drivers and any additional software to get Windows Mixed Reality up and running.

## Make sure you have a compatible graphics driver

Your PC needs a WDDM 2.2 or later graphics driver in order to complete Windows Mixed Reality setup. If it doesn't already have a compatible graphics driver, try these sources:

* Check for the latest critical driver updates using Windows Update (**Start > Windows Settings > Update and Security > Check for Updates**)
* Check for the latest optional driver updates:
    1. Right-click **Start > Device Manager**.
    2. Expand **Display Adapters**.
    3. Right-click on the graphics card and choose **Update Driver > Search automatically for updated driver software**.
* Check the website for the manufacturer (OEM) of your PC.
* Check the website for the manufacturer of the graphics card in your PC (for example, AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA).

## Make sure that you have any required adapters

Your Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC may not have the full-sized HDMI and USB 3.0 ports needed to connect your immersive headset. You might also need a Bluetooth adapter to meet the Windows Mixed Reality Portal requirements.  If that's the case, you'll need adapters to connect your headset and motion controllers. Make sure to review the list of [adapter types and recommendations on specific adapter models](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md).

## Make sure that you have input devices

Windows Mixed Reality is designed to work best with Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers, which provide natural, precise interactions with no need to install hardware on your walls. But you can also use an Xbox controller or a mouse and keyboard.

## Make sure that you have a large, open space

If you want to move around while using Windows Mixed Reality you'll need to have a large, open space.  During setup, you'll be asked to choose between "Seated and standing" or "All experiences". Choose "All experiences" and set up a boundary if you want to move around. Review the [immersive headset health, safety, and comfort guidelines](wmr-health-safety-comfort.md) to understand the space requirements.

### Seated and standing (no boundary)

If you select "Seated and standing," you'll be using your headset without a boundary. This means you'll need to stay in one spot when using the headset to avoid physical obstacles and tripping hazards. You can sit down or stand up, but you shouldn't move around. Some apps might be designed to work with a boundary, so they might not work or provide the same experience if you use them without one.

### All experiences (boundary)

If you choose "All experiences," you'll set up a boundary and be able to move around app experiences that work with a boundary and those that don't require one. Prepare your space by making sure there are no obstacles, hazards, or fragile items in the area you’ll be using - including above your head. Don’t set up at the top of a staircase or under an extra-low ceiling fan. Remove breakables and obstacles from the area, and make sure everyone using your headset reads and understands the [safety guidelines](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039969/windows-10-mixed-reality-immersive-headset-health-safety-comfort).
