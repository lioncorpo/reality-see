# Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap of the Mixed Reality Toolkit. Please note that the following reflects work that is in development and target dates reflect estimates.

## Current release

Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit v2.6

## Upcoming releases

| Product | Description | Timeline | Project board |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MRTK V2.7](#270) | Next iteration of MRTK | May 2021 | https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/14 |

Releases are centered around themes (ex: large feature areas) and are scheduled to occur approximately every 8-12 weeks.

Release details, including backlog items, can be found on the [GitHub milestone pages](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestones). The complete set of open issues can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues).

## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is built to be cross MR/AR/VR/XR platform by design. The toolkit currently supports Unity 2019.4.x and Unity 2018.4.x.

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. Although the Mixed Reality Toolkit runs on the latest non-beta (ex: 2020.1) tech branch version of Unity, it is not officially supported.

### 2.7.0

We are currently planning the 2.7.0 release and will have more updates for you soon!
For the latest status of the release, please visit the [milestone page](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/14).

Status: Planning

Target Timeline: May 2021

Themes:

- Stability 
- Platform Expansion: OpenXR
- User Experience
- Developer Education
- Packaging

**Stability**

Quality and stability are the top priority for this and all Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit releases. We will continue to prioritize customer and partner issues that impact the stability of MRTK components.

**Platform Expansion: OpenXR**

The MRTK team supports the open future of mixed reality through [OpenXR](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/moving-forward-to-openxr/ba-p/1825672). Support for OpenXR is currently under development, with initial preview support released in MRTK 2.5.2.

**User Experience**

We're listening to your feedback about MRTK and have continued plans for:

- Bug fixes
- Making MRTK UX controls easier to understand
- HoloLens Shell parity
- Tests to ensure features do not regress

**Developer Education**

We've migrated our developer documentation from Github to a new docs platform! We want to hear your feedback so we can continue to improve our developer documentation experience.
We currently have [MRTK tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/tutorials) that live in a different section of Mixed Reality docs. We will be migrating these tutorials to live with the rest of the MRTK documentation. 

**Packaging**

The [Mixed Reality Feature Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool) is a new way for developers to discover, update, and add Mixed Reality feature packages into Unity projects. You can search packages by name or category, see their dependencies, and even view proposed changes to your projects manifest file before importing. We intend to make updates to the Mixed Reality Feature Tool as we respond to feature requests and bugs.

## Backlog

The following list highlights some of the key investments the MRTK team intends to pursue.

- Platform expansion
- Extensibility
- Modularity
- Accessibility features
- Globalization enhancements
- Cloud service support
